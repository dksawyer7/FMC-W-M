      <p>
        Founded in the spring of 2018 by a small group of finance enthusiasts at William &amp; Mary,
        the Financial Modeling Club has grown into a vibrant community of 200+ students across all majors.
        We saw a gap between classroom theory and the real-world spreadsheets used by professionals—
        so we set out to build hands-on workshops, speaker events, and mentoring that equip every member
        with marketable modeling skills.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h3 mt-5 mb-4">Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        We envision a William &amp; Mary where every student—regardless of year or major—can
        build, test, and present financial models with confidence. By fostering collaboration,
        peer-to-peer teaching, and connections to alumni in investment firms, we aim to launch
        the next generation of analysts, advisors, and entrepreneurs.
