## GitHub Pages

This repository is set up to deploy a static version of the site using **GitHub Pages**. All site files now live inside the `docs/` directory, including HTML pages, the `static/` assets, and the `data/` folder used by JavaScript. Assets are referenced with relative paths so they load correctly once published. A `.nojekyll` file in that folder disables Jekyll processing, allowing the directory structure to be served as-is.
