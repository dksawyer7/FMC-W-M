## Mission Statement

Through hands-on workshops, professional networking, and peer-driven learning, we provide a welcoming space for all students eager to develop and apply financial modeling expertise. We're here to help you succeedâ€”and we're excited to have you join us at our next session!

## GitHub Pages

This repository is set up to deploy a static version of the site using **GitHub Pages**. All HTML files live in the `docs/` directory and assets are referenced with relative paths so they load correctly once published. A `.nojekyll` file in that folder disables Jekyll processing, allowing the directory structure to be served as-is.
