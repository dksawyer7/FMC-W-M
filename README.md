## Mission Statement

The Financial Modeling Club at William & Mary is a collaborative, student-led organization dedicated to equipping members with the technical skills needed to excel in the classroom, stand out in internships, and thrive in competitive careers across the financial sector. Open to students of all experience levels, the club is designed to teach the fundamentals of Microsoft Excel and financial modeling tools essential for success in the corporate world. Our mission is not only to help students build a strong technical foundation, but also to support them throughout the recruiting process and guide them as they navigate their professional journeys. By fostering a hands-on, inclusive learning environment, we aim to give every member a competitive advantage in their career path.

## GitHub Pages

This repository is set up to deploy a static version of the site using **GitHub Pages**. All site files now live inside the `docs/` directory, including HTML pages, the `static/` assets, and the `data/` folder used by JavaScript. Assets are referenced with relative paths so they load correctly once published. A `.nojekyll` file in that folder disables Jekyll processing, allowing the directory structure to be served as-is.
